# Perceptrons

## parallel processing
+ SIMD: single in struction, multiple data machines, all processors execute the same instruction but on different pieces of data
+ MIMD: multiple data machines, different processors may execute different instructions on different data
+ NIMD: neural instruction, multiple data (NIMD) machines, where each processor corresponds to a neuron, local parameters correspond to its synaptic weights, and the whole structure is a neural network (machines where processors are a little bit more complex than SIMD processors but not as complex as MIMD processors)
